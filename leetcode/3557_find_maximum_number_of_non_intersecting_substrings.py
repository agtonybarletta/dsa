class Solution:
    """
    You are given a string word.

    Return the maximum number of non-intersecting substrings of word that are at least four characters long and start and end with the same letter.

    A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.

    Example 1:

    Input: word = abcdeafdef

    Output: 2

    Explanation:

    The two substrings are abcdea and fdef.

    Example 2:

    Input: word = bcdaaaab

    Output: 1

    Explanation:

    The only substring is aaaa. Note that we cannot also choose bcdaaaab since it intersects with the other substring.

    Â 

    Constraints:

    1 <= word.length <= 2 * 105
    word consists only of lowercase English letters.
